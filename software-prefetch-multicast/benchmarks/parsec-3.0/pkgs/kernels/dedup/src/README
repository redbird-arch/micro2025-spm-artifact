Allows to execute Dedup pthreads with limited memory. Currently
the limit is hardcoded to 1400MB of physical memory.

encoder-ompss-only-deps.c
-------------------------
Compress stage is independent of the fragment_refine_and_deduplicate.
This version has 3 task types. In terms of performance, it doesn't 
improve over the original code on MareNostrum. Raul didn't try it on
the big.LITTLE machine.
